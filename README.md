# MicroLLMFineTuneQA
---
Research project for efficient fine-tuning of compact language models for natural language question answering

MicroLLMFineTune is a research initiative focused on developing optimized methods for fine-tuning small-scale language models (up to 1.5 billion parameters) specifically for natural language question answering (QA) tasks. This project explores the balance between computational efficiency, response quality, and resource accessibility for researchers and developers working with limited computational budgets.

### Key Objectives
🎯 Investigate effective adaptation strategies for small LLMs on specialized QA tasks

⚡ Optimize fine-tuning processes for models under the 1.5B parameter constraint

📊 Benchmark performance against larger foundation models while maintaining efficiency

🔧 Develop knowledge distillation and transfer learning techniques for compact architectures

🌍 Support multilingual QA scenarios with focus on resource-constrained languages
### Datasets
The project primarily utilizes the SimpleQA dataset - a carefully curated collection of question-answer pairs designed specifically for training and evaluating compact language models
